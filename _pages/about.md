Welcome to my personal website! I'm currently pursuing an MSc in Data Science at [√âcole Polytechnique F√©d√©rale de Lausanne](https://www.epfl.ch/education/master/programs/data-science/),
where I also do research at the [Laboratory for Information and Inference Systems](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/lions/).
My current research revolves around **graph neural networks**, **reinforcement learning**, and **self-supervised learning** 
for combinatorial optimization problems. Prior to my master's degree, I completed a BSc in Data Science and Artificial 
Intelligence at [Maastricht University](https://www.maastrichtuniversity.nl/education/bachelor/data-science-and-artificial-intelligence).

During my bachelor's studies, I had the opportunity to delve into applied research in various areas. As an AI research 
intern at Aucos AG, I worked on projects involving **multi-camera multi-object tracking**, and **multi-agent** 
reinforcement learning.

My primary interests in research lie within the exciting fields of machine learning and artificial intelligence, with a 
particular emphasis on reinforcement learning and multi-task learning. For more in-depth information about my work, feel free to explore the
[publications](/publications/) and [projects](/projects/) pages!

When I'm not doing research, you can find me skiing down slopes ‚õ∑, exploring scenic hiking trails ü•æüèûÔ∏è, 
or participating in field hockey üèë. 

Thank you for visiting my personal website. Feel free to reach out to
me with any inquiries or opportunities you'd like to discuss!
