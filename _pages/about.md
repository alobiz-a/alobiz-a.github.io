I am a student in the MSc in Data Science at 
[École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne](https://www.epfl.ch/education/master/programs/data-science/), where I do
research in reinforcement learning. I am the  PR Manager of the [Google Developer Student Club](https://gdsc.community.dev/epfl/). 
Before starting my master’s, I obtained my BSc in Data Science and Artificial Intelligence at 
[Maastricht University](https://www.maastrichtuniversity.nl/education/bachelor/data-science-and-artificial-intelligence)
. During my bachelor’s, I worked on applied research in multi-camera multi-object tracking and multi-agent reinforcement
learning as an AI research intern at Aucos AG.

My research focus lies in machine learning and artificial intelligence, with a focus on reinforcement learning. Further 
details about my research can be found on the [publications](/publications/) page, where can you find my preprints.

In my personal time, I very much enjoy writing (take for example my book about reinforcement learning), skiing, hiking, 
and field hockey.
