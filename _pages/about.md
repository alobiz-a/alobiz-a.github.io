I am a student in the MSc in Data Science at 
[École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne](https://www.epfl.ch/education/master/programs/data-science/), where I am the 
PR Manager of the [Google Developer Student Club](https://gdsc.community.dev/epfl/). Before starting my master's, I 
obtained my BSc in Data Science and Artificial Intelligence at 
[Maastricht University](https://www.maastrichtuniversity.nl/education/bachelor/data-science-and-artificial-intelligence).
During my bachelor's, I worked on applied research in multi-camera multi-object tracking and multi-agent reinforcement 
learning as an AI research intern at Aucos AG.

My research focus lies in machine learning and artificial intelligence, with a focus on reinforcement learning. Further 
details about my research can be found on the publications page.

In my personal time, I very much enjoy writing (take for example my book about reinforcement learning), skiing, hiking,
and exploring new interests.
