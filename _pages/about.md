Welcome to my kingdom! I'm currently in my final year of my MSci in Physics at [Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/research-and-innovation/), with research interests in computational neuroscience, device physics, robotics and neuroengineering.

From 2022 to 2023, I spend a year abroad at Switzerland's [√âcole Polytechnique F√©d√©rale de Lausanne](https://www.epfl.ch/education/master/programs/data-science/), working at the [Neuroengineering Laboratory](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/ramdya-lab/) on two projects. The first involved developing **computer vision tools** via **transfer learning** to track key-points of the *Drosophila melanogaster* and perform **inverse kinematics** to replay its behaviour in a simulated, **digital twin**. In the second, I used real, **neural connections** data as the basis for a **temporal graph neural network** that was trained to generate oscillatory signals, to model a modulated, central pattern generator for **locomotion**.

I am also involved with ETH Zurich's [Institute for Neuroinformatics](https://www.ini.uzh.ch/en/myINI.html), where I worked on **neuromorphic-based prosthetics** that emulate biology and use **spiking neural networks**. For more details of my work, please explore my [projects](/projects/) page.

I am also currently involved with [Rounded.News](https://rounded.news) as the Chief AI Strategist, a start-up attempting
to break filter bubbles using AI-powered news üì∞.

During my bachelor's studies, I had the opportunity to delve into applied research in various areas. As an AI research 
intern at Aucos AG, I worked on projects involving **multi-camera multi-object tracking**, and **multi-agent systems**.

My primary research interests lie within the exciting fields of machine learning and artificial intelligence, with a 
particular emphasis on reinforcement learning and multi-task learning. For more in-depth information about my work, feel
free to explore the [publications](/publications/) and [projects](/projects/) pages!

Additionally, I am committed to leveraging my skills and knowledge to create positive impact and make a difference in 
people's lives. I believe in the power of collaboration, innovation, and entrepreneurship to drive meaningful 
change. Through my involvement in various associations, hackathons, and initiatives, I have gained invaluable 
experience in addressing real-world challenges and contributing to sustainability efforts ‚ôª. I am excited about 
opportunities to further expand my horizons and contribute to projects that align with this ideology.

When I'm not doing research or working on my projects, you can find me skiing down slopes ‚õ∑, exploring scenic hiking 
trails ü•æüèûÔ∏è, or participating in field hockey üèë. 

Thank you for visiting my personal website. I welcome collaboration and invite you to reach out (see the bottom of this
page), whether you have ideas for impactful projects, opportunities for partnership, or simply want to connect!
