This is a project that was completed in Fall 2020 for the Project 1-1 course at my bachelor's [Data Science and Artificial Intelligence](https://www.maastrichtuniversity.nl/education/bachelor/data-science-and-artificial-intelligence/courses-curriculum)
at Maastricht University. I have not yet had the time to get all of the information in the right place, but I will update
this page with an interactive final product, the report, and the code.
