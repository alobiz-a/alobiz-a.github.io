This [ML4Science](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/mlo/ml4science/) project was done for the [CS-433 Machine Learning](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/mlo/machine-learning-cs-433/) course
taught at EPFL in Fall 2022. We are generously hosted by [Volvo Group Trucks Technology](https://www.volvogroup.com/en/) 
and [Chalmers University of Technology](https://www.chalmers.se/en/Pages/default.aspx) to work on this project.
